Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
The main objective of Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is to use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal or a fraud.
The steps involved in the project are:
1. Read and understand the data
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Normalization of data
4. Visualization of correlations
5. Model Architecture-(SupportVectorClassifier,KNeighborsClassifier)
6. Model Evaluation and Prediction

Conclusion:By using KNeighbors and SupportVector we get 91% and 93% accuracy respestively.
